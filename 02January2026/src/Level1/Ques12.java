/*Write a program to find the sum of n natural numbers using while loop compare the result with the formulae n*(n+1)/2 and show the result from both computations was correct.
Hint =>
Take the user input number and check whether it's a Natural number
If it's a natural number Compute using formulae as well as compute using while loop
Compare the two results and print the result
