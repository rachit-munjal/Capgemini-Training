/*Write a Program to find the factorial of an integer entered by the user.
Hint =>
For example, the factorial of 4 is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 which is 24.
Take an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable. Check the user has entered a positive integer.
Using a while loop, compute the factorial.
Print the factorial at the end.
