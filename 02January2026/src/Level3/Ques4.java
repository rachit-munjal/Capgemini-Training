/*Write a Program to check if the given n is a prime n or not
Hint =>
A n that can be divided exactly only by itself and 1 are Prime Ns,
Prime Ns checks are done for ns greater than 1
Loop through all the ns from 2 to the user input n and check if the reminder is zero. If the reminder is zero break out from the loop as the n is divisible by some other n and is not a prime n.
Use the isPrime boolean variable to store the result
