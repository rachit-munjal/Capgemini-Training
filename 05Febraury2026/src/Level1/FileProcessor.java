/*You are tasked with reading data from multiple files and processing them. Ensure that each file
is closed properly after processing, even if an exception occurs. Implement the following:
1. Create a class FileProcessor with a method processFiles(List<String>
filePaths) that reads the contents of each file from the provided list of file paths. Use
BufferedReader to read the file contents.
2. Handle exceptions: Catch and handle IOException during file reading. Ensure that all
resources (file readers) are properly closed using the try-with-resources statement.
