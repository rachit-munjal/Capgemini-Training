/*Problem 1: Library and Books (Aggregation)
Description: Create a Library class that contains multiple Book objects. Model the relationship such that a library can have many books, but a book can exist independently (outside of a specific library).
Tasks:
Define a Library class with an ArrayList of Book objects.
Define a Book class with attributes such as title and author.
Demonstrate the aggregation relationship by creating books and adding them to different libraries.
Goal: Understand aggregation by modeling a real-world relationship where the Library aggregates Book objects.
