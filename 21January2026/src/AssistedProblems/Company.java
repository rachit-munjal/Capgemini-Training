/*Problem 3: Company and Departments (Composition)
Description: A Company has several Department objects, and each department contains Employee objects. Model this using composition, where deleting a company should also delete all departments and employees.
Tasks:
Define a Company class that contains multiple Department objects.
Define an Employee class within each Department.
Show the composition relationship by ensuring that when a Company object is deleted, all associated Department and Employee objects are also removed.
Goal: Understand composition by implementing a relationship where Department and Employee objects cannot exist without a Company.
